                     <h6>Purpose / Scope of Application</h6>

                        <h6>General Principles</h6>
                        <p>A fundamental rule about how we act is the principle of abiding by the laws and statutes in the relevant jurisdiction in which we are active. All employees are obligated to comply with the statutory regulations that apply to us. The same applies to the in-house instructions and guidelines. Our principles also include avoiding any participation in transactions which are recognizably aimed at circumventing statutory provisions. Every employee has an obligation to safeguard the reputation of iGas and to avoid doing anything that might harm the company.

                              <p>Our employees must avoid situations which might result in personal conflicts of interest or conflicts of interest with our business partners. In particular, the paragraph specified below concerning the fight against corruption must be noted in this regard. Every employee must immediately notify the HR department and management of any business relationships of a private nature with companies which are directly associated with iGas. Equated with this are interests in companies as part of a governing body of such companies.
                                </p>

We expect our employees not to provide information that has been unfairly acquired and we clearly advocate a policy of absolute confidentiality.
                                  </p>
                                  <h6>Competition / Ban on Cartels</h6>
                                  <p>iGas is committed to the principle of pursuing its corporate goals using absolutely legal and ethical means.

                                    <h6>Combating Corruption</h6>
                                    <p>Our goal is to compete fairly and to convince people with the quality and value of our products and we resolutely object to bribery and unfair competition. None of our employees may use his or her job and business connections of the company for his or her own benefit or for the benefit of a third party or to the detriment of iGas. This means that in dealing with business partners no employee shall offer or accept private benefits such as money and/or items or services which are intended or likely to influence appropriate decisions. Every iGas employee is authorized and obligated to obtain advice and assistance when there is suspicion or doubts about the existence of corruption or white-collar crime. Advice and assistance are offered in every case by management, the legal department and the works council.
                                      </p>
                                      <h6>Dealings with Business Partners</h6>
                                      <p>We are committed to the principle of dealing fairly and openly with our business partners. In particular, we make every effort to cooperate in the best possible manner with our customers, so that they can make a reasonable and informed decision that is in accordance with their interests. Potential conflicts of interests with customers and other business partners must be recognized in good time, avoided as much as possible or – where this is not possible – resolved appropriately.
                                        </p>
                                        <h6>Integrity of Information/Communication</h6>
                                        <p>All records and reports must be correct, complete and truthful, regardless of whether they are used for in-house communications or external communications. This applies in particular to the bookkeeping and financial statements as well as the other reports on the growth of the business and the financial position of the company. Official statements to the media and communication with the media shall be made only by management or employees expressly authorized to do so.
                                          </p>
                                          <h6>Environment</h6>
                                          <p>iGas declares its responsibility for environmental protection and sustainability. It has therefore drafted rules and guidelines for the protection of the environment, with which its employees are directed to comply. This leads to the employees having an obligation when taking actions or making decisions to consider the impact on the environment and to avoid environmental pollution as much as possible.
                                            </p>
                                            <h6>Protection of Corporate Assets</h6>
                                            <p>Our company’s assets include not only tangible items/property but also intangible assets (intellectual property including software products), information, and the ideas and know-how of our employees. Every employee is responsible for protecting these corporate assets. The corporate assets may only be used for permitted business purposes and under no circumstances for illegal purposes.
                                              </p>
                                              <h6>Donations/Sponsorship</h6>
                                              <p>In the case of donations and sponsorship, we take care to ensure compliance with the regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the provisions applying internally in this regard. Donations may be made to institutions for the purpose of promoting education and science, art and culture and for social purposes or other purposes considered worthy of support. No donations are made to political parties.
                                                </p> 
                                                <h6>Implementation</h6>
                                                <p>This Code of Ethics is a living part of our corporate culture and hence part of the day to day working life of all employees working at iGas. Every employee is therefore responsible for compliance with the rules and principles stipulated in this Code of Ethics. The supervisors/management staff shall ensure that their employees are familiar with the content of this Code of Ethics and observe the rules and principles that apply to them; they shall through their own conduct serve as examples. Conversely, employees should contact their supervisors if they have any doubts as to the application of these guidelines. The management of iGas feels, itself, particularly bound by this Code of Ethics and will use all means to enforce these guidelines or to have them enforced.
                                                  </p>
